On the Yang Mills Mass Gap and the Characteristic of Primes


A non-perturbative proof of the existence of the Yang Mills Mass Gap, seeming to also prove the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture as a corrollory on the nature of rigid prime-adjacenct structure of spectral bands. (We would imagine numerous Langlands conjectures too, considering the depth of the program and that rigid prime adjacency is now proven to be an admitted invariant in the Galois groups.)

The Yang Mills Mass Gap problem - one of the Millennium Prize Problems established by the Clay Mathematics Institute - has often been discussed as undecidable.  Various arguements invoking Turing machines, Penrose tilings, Godel's incompleteness theorems,and Tarski's semantic undecidability claim that determining the existence of a spectralgap lies beyond computational grasp. 

In direct contrast to these conclusions,  we introduce a series of papers to explicitlydemonstrate not only the computability and existence of the Yang{Mills mass gap, but its intrinsic invariance within the algebraic and topological structures of gauge theories and Lie groups. We specically show that spectral and mass gaps naturally arise as categorical invariants within all groups of Lie type analyzed thus far. This introductory paper forms part of a series exploring various structural and non-perturbative  analyses  across  operator theory, group theory, cohomology, modular forms, and automorphic representations. 

We commence with a concise demonstration via key PDEs.
