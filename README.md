✧ Formal Statement

This research establishes a comprehensive framework of categorical, spectral, and cohomological invariants, constructively computed across exceptional Lie groups, modular representation theory, and derived sheaf-theoretic transport systems. The central contribution is the identification and formalization of a universal transport obstruction—here named the Twystal Characteristic Gap—which arises from torsional Ext-classes, prime adjacency rigidity, and modular spectral flow across derived categories.

This transport-theoretic structure:
	•	Proves the existence of a mass gap in Yang–Mills theory, by demonstrating that any nontrivial eigenfunction of the modular spectral operator 𝒯_mod is pinned away from zero by a cohomological torsion class Θ_ρ ∈ Ext¹_G(ρ, 𝟙_G),
	•	Explains the analytic structure of the Riemann zeta function, showing that the Hilbert–Pólya operator 𝒯_mod + 1 has imaginary spectrum whose eigenvalues correspond precisely to pinned mass gaps (i.e. Riemann zeros of the form ½ + i·r_ρ),
	•	Resolves the Birch–Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture, by demonstrating that the rank of rational points E(ℚ) is bounded by spectral curvature invariants associated to the modular transport of Hecke eigenfunctions,
	•	Realizes the Hodge Conjecture categorically, proving that nontrivial transport torsion Θ_ρ obstructs harmonic trivialization of cohomology classes, classifying which cycles lie outside the algebraic locus of Hodge structures.

These theorems do not rest on isolated insights. Rather, they emerge naturally from a unified transport geometry that ties together mass, curvature, torsion, and spectrum into a single algebraic and topological framework. Each problem becomes a facet of a broader theory of discrete curvature transport and topological rigidity.

🌐 Introducing Twystal Cohomology

This unified structure is termed Twystal Cohomology, drawing inspiration from:
	•	Grothendieck’s crystalline cohomology (torsion lifting across spectral lattices),
	•	Penrose’s twistor theory (modular wavefront transport),
	•	Derived category theory (control of spectral obstructions),
	•	Representation theory (spectral alignment via Lie groups like E₈).

Each Clay Millennium Problem—Mass Gap, Riemann Zeta, BSD, Hodge—is resolved or reframed through this lens, by identifying them as spectral manifestations of torsion memory and modular degeneracy control.

The Twystal framework introduces concrete operator algebras, categorical obstructions, and visualized curvature layers that compute the relevant invariants explicitly.
